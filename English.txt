Create a simple web application, which will execute a long time execution REST request

Initial data - a text file with the list of names and birthdates (in a suitable for the developer format).
REST service should receive one optional parameter - month number (from 1 to 12) and should return the list of names, that has a birthday in this month.
If the parameter is not set - the current month should be used.
The response should be in JSON format. The service should emulate the a long time execution request (1-2 min for processing).

The service should have two end points:
1. a REST end point to set the tasks for execution. This one receives an optional parameter (month number) and should return a process ID.
2. a REST end point to receive a results of processing. This one receives a process ID as an input parameter. And return the results if it is ready or service should return a message that task is in progress if the execution is not finished.

The application should be built in Spring framework. The logging framework should be used.
Use an assembly tool. The application should be able to run in any JEE container.

You may use any library you want. Java version: 7 (8 is preferable).
